We moved an island closer and added a skull rock on top of this. We moved one of the collectable items into the mouth of the skull.
We added a lose button on top of some rocks. It’s activated on touch.
To warn the player for the lose button, the button is surrounded by green bubbles
An extra enemy is added. This is a giraffe which shoots very fast but very inaccurately.
To warn players of the evil giraffe, a hazard sound is added near the giraffe which is activated when the player is close. 
Changed crystal pickup sound to “explode” for some crystals.
We added some floating birds.
To win you need to also pick up 2 pieces of fruit
Near the end, there is a hippo with a collectable crystal for you to pick up. 
There is now an extra route to another win block which you need to touch. It is on a new island where a mountain and some trees and flowers have been added.
